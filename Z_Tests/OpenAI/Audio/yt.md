Understand the anima.

"Ever feel like you have these... conflicting voices in your head? One minute you're all logic and ambition, ready to conquer the world, the next, you're yearning for connection and creative expression? You're not alone."

"You see, Jung, a famous psychologist, believed that within every woman lies an 'animus' â€“ her inner masculine side. It's not about being a man, but about the masculine traits we all carry: logic, assertiveness, the drive to achieve. When this animus is out of balance, it can cause problems."

I was thinking lately about a friend...

"Anya's animus was running the show. It made her hyper-competitive, critical, and unable to connect with her own emotions or vulnerability. It was like she was constantly fighting, either with others or herself."

"But Anya learned that integrating her animus wasn't about suppressing it. It was about understanding it. She learned to channel that assertiveness into her work, but also to embrace her softer side, her need for connection, her creative fire. It's about finding that balance within, and that's when everything changed."

Thats why you need to
