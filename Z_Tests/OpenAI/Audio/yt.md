We often hear about finding the light, about positivity, but what if I told you that true growth, that real transformation, comes from embracing your darkness? Stick around, because we're going deep into the concept of the 'shadow self' with the legendary psychologist, Carl Jung."

"Think about the word 'enlightenment'. What comes to mind? Maybe images of serene figures bathed in light, completely at peace, totally 'good'. We're often sold this idea that enlightenment is about pure positivity, transcending all negativity, being perfect. But what if I told you that's only half the story?"

This is where Carl Jung comes in.

One of his most powerful concepts is the 'shadow self.

Jung believed that we all have a shadow – it's the part of our personality that we tend to hide, deny, or reject.

It's the stuff we don't like about ourselves: our fears, our insecurities, our negative emotions, even some of our 'unacceptable' desires. 

It's basically everything we don't want to admit is part of us."

"Now, you might be thinking, 'Why would I want to look at that? I'm trying to be positive!'.

But Jung argued that ignoring our shadow is like ignoring a wound – it doesn't make it go away, it just festers.
