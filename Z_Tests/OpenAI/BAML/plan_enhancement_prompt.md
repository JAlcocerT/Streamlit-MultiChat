You are given the current content of a project's reference documentation (below). Your task is to create a detailed plan for what should be researched, added, or improved to enhance the depth and usefulness of this documentation. Focus on identifying:
- Gaps in technical depth or missing advanced topics
- Opportunities for more examples, diagrams, or explanations
- Areas where real-world use cases or design rationale could be added
- Any missing references to code, APIs, or architecture
- Suggestions for structure or clarity improvements

Return your plan as a JSON array of objects with actionable recommendations.

Example structure:

[
  {
    "recommendation": "Expand on advanced topics related to modules integrations."
  },
  {
    "recommendation": "Add more real-world use cases of the project under analysis."
  },
]
